Application Notes (up to 4 pages; this is approx. 2,600 words or 2,000 
words plus one figure): Applications Notes are short descriptions of novel 
software or new algorithm implementations, databases and network services 
(web servers, and interfaces). Software or data must be freely available 
to non-commercial users. Availability and Implementation must be clearly 
stated in the article. Authors must also ensure that the software is 
available for a full two years following publication. Web services must 
not require mandatory registration by the user. Additional supplementary 
data can be published online-only by the journal. This supplementary 
material should be referred to in the abstract of the Application Note. If 
describing software, the software should run under nearly all conditions 
on a wide range of machines. Web servers should not be browser specific. 
Application Notes must not describe trivial utilities, nor involve 
significant investment of time for the user to install. The name of the 
application should be included in the title.
