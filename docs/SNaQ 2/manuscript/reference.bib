  abstract = {Altitudinal gradients are characterized by steep changes of the physical and biotic environment that present challenges to plant adaptation throughout large parts of the world. Hybrid zones may form where related species inhabit different neighbouring altitudes and can facilitate interspecific gene flow and potentially the breakdown of species barriers. Studies of such hybrid zones can reveal much about the genetic basis of adaptation to environmental differences stemming from changes in altitude and the maintenance of species divergence in the face of gene flow. Furthermore, owing to recombination and transgressive effects, such hybrid zones can be sources of evolutionary novelty. We document plant hybrid zones associated with altitudinal gradients and emphasize similarities and differences in their structure. We then focus on recent studies of a hybrid zone between two               Senecio               species that occur at high and low altitude on Mount Etna, Sicily, showing how adaptation to local environments and intrinsic selection against hybrids act to maintain it. Finally, we consider the potential of altitudinal hybrid zones for generating evolutionary novelty through adaptive introgression and hybrid speciation. Examples of homoploid hybrid species of               Senecio               and               Pinus               that originated from altitudinal hybrid zones are discussed.},

The gene duplication and loss process is a major cause for incongruence between gene and species tree, and deterministic methods have been developed to explain such differences through tree reconciliations. Although probabilistic methods for phylogenetic inference have been around for decades, probabilistic reconciliation methods are far less established. Based on our model, we have implemented a Bayesian analysis tool, PrIME-GSR, for gene tree inference that takes a known species tree into account. Our implementation is sound and we demonstrate its utility for genomewide gene-family analysis by applying it to recently presented yeast data. We validate PrIME-GSR by comparing with previous analyses of these data that take advantage of gene order information. In a case study we apply our method to the ADH gene family and are able to draw biologically relevant conclusions concerning gene duplications creating key yeast phenotypes. On a higher level this shows the biological relevance of our method. The obtained results demonstrate the value of a relaxed molecular clock. Our good performance will extend to species where gene order conservation is insufficient.},

The method is suitable for both markers with fixed allelic differences between the species and markers without fixed differences. The probability model used is one in which parentals and various classes of hybrids (F(1)'s, F(2)'s, and various backcrosses) form a mixture from which the sample is drawn. Using the framework of Bayesian model-based clustering allows us to compute, by Markov chain Monte Carlo, the posterior probability that each individual belongs to each of the distinct hybrid classes. We demonstrate the method on allozyme data from two species of hybridizing trout, as well as on two simulated data sets.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Comparative genomics in general and orthology analysis in particular are becoming increasingly important parts of gene function prediction. Previously, orthology analysis and reconciliation has been performed only with respect to the parsimony model. This discards many plausible solutions and sometimes precludes finding the correct one. In many other areas in bioinformatics probabilistic models have proven to be both more realistic and powerful than parsimony models. For instance, they allow for assessing solution reliability and consideration of alternative solutions in a uniform way. There is also an added benefit in making model assumptions explicit and therefore making model comparisons possible. For orthology analysis, uncertainty has recently been addressed using parsimonious reconciliation combined with bootstrap techniques. However, until now no probabilistic methods have been available.             Results: We introduce a probabilistic gene evolution model based on a birth-death process in which a gene tree evolves `inside' a species tree. Based on this model, we develop a tool with the capacity to perform practical orthology analysis, based on Fitch's original definition, and more generally for reconciling pairs of gene and species trees. Our gene evolution model is biologically sound (Nei et al., 1997) and intuitively attractive. We develop a Bayesian analysis based on MCMC which facilitates approximation of an a posteriori distribution for reconciliations. That is, we can find the most probable reconciliations and estimate the probability of any reconciliation, given the observed gene tree. This also gives a way to estimate the probability that a pair of genes are orthologs. The main algorithmic contribution presented here consists of an algorithm for computing the likelihood of a given reconciliation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first successful introduction of this type of probabilistic methods, which flourish in phylogeny analysis, into reconciliation and orthology analysis. The MCMC algorithm has been implemented and, although not yet being in its final form, tests show that it performs very well on synthetic as well as biological data. Using standard correspondences, our results carry over to allele trees as well as biogeography.

Current paradigms for phylogenetic tree reconstruction rely on performing costly likelihood optimizations. With the aim of making tree inference feasible for problems involving more than a handful of sequences, inference under the maximum-likelihood paradigm integrates heuristic approaches to evaluate only a subset of all potential trees. Consequently, existing methods suffer from the known tradeoff between accuracy and running time. In this proof-of-concept study, we train a machine-learning algorithm over an extensive cohort of empirical data to predict the neighboring trees that increase the likelihood, without actually computing their likelihood. This provides means to safely discard a large set of the search space, thus potentially accelerating heuristic tree searches without losing accuracy. Our analyses suggest that machine learning can guide tree-search methodologies towards the most promising candidate trees.},

Placement can be used to update phylogenies in a scalable fashion and can help identify unknown query samples using (meta-)barcoding, skimming, or metagenomic data. Maximum likelihood (ML) methods of phylogenetic placement exist, but these methods are not scalable to reference trees with many thousands of leaves, limiting their ability to enjoy benefits of dense taxon sampling in modern reference libraries. They also rely on assembled sequences for the reference set and aligned sequences for the query. Thus, ML methods cannot analyze data sets where the reference consists of unassembled reads, a scenario relevant to emerging applications of genome skimming for sample identification. We introduce APPLES, a distance-based method for phylogenetic placement. Compared to ML, APPLES is an order of magnitude faster and more memory efficient, and unlike ML, it is able to place on large backbone trees (tested for up to 200,000 leaves). We show that using dense references improves accuracy substantially so that APPLES on dense trees is more accurate than ML on sparser trees, where it can run. Finally, APPLES can accurately identify samples without assembled reference or aligned queries using kmer-based distances, a scenario that ML cannot handle. APPLES is available publically at github.com/balabanmetin/apples.},

However, attempts to reconstruct optimal intraspecific mtDNA phylogenies frequently fail because parallel mutation events partly obscure the true evolutionary pathways. This makes it inadvisable to present a single phylogenetic tree at the expense of neglecting equally acceptable ones. As an alternative, we propose a novel network approach for portraying mtDNA relationships. For small sample sizes (\&lt; approximately 50), an unmodified median network contains all most parsimonious trees, displays graphically the full information content of the sequence data, and can easily be generated by hand. For larger sample sizes, we reduce the complexity of the network by identifying parallelisms. This reduction procedure is guided by a compatibility argument and an additional source of phylogenetic information: the frequencies of the mitochondrial haplotypes. As a spin-off, our approach can also assist in identifying sequencing errors, which manifest themselves in implausible network substructures. We illustrate the advantages of our approach with several examples from existing data sets.},

  abstract = {Hybridization events complicate the accurate reconstruction of phylogenies, as they lead to patterns of genetic heritability that are unexpected under traditional, bifurcating models of species trees. This has led to the development of methods to infer these varied hybridization events, both methods that reconstruct networks directly, and summary methods that predict individual hybridization events. However, a lack of empirical comparisons between methods - especially pertaining to large networks with varied hybridization scenarios - hinders their practical use. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of popular summary methods: TICR, MSCquartets, HyDe, Patterson's D-Statistic (ABBA-BABA), D3, and Dp. TICR and MSCquartets are based on quartet concordance factors gathered from gene tree topologies and Patterson's D-Statistic, D3, and Dp use site pattern frequencies to identify hybridization events. We then use simulated data to address questions of method accuracy and ideal use scenarios by testing methods against complex networks which depict gene flow events that differ in depth (timing), quantity (single vs. multiple, overlapping hybridizations), and rate of gene flow. We find that deeper or multiple hybridization events may introduce noise and weaken the signal of hybridization, leading to higher false negative rates across methods. Despite some forms of hybridization eluding quartet-based detection methods, MSCquartets displays high precision in most scenarios. While HyDe results in high false negative rates when tested on hybridizations involving ghost lineages, HyDe is the only method to be able to separate hybrid vs parent signals. Lastly, we test the methods on ultraconserved elements from the bee subfamily Nomiinae, finding the possibility of hybridization events between clades which correspond to regions of poor support in the species tree estimated in the original study.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Genomic data have had a profound impact on nearly every biological discipline. In systematics and phylogenetics, the thousands of loci that are now being sequenced can be analyzed under the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) to explicitly account for gene tree discordance due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). However, the MSC assumes no gene flow post divergence, calling for additional methods that can accommodate this limitation. Explicit phylogenetic network methods have emerged, which can simultaneously account for ILS and gene flow by representing evolutionary history as a directed acyclic graph. In this point of view, we highlight some of the strengths and limitations of phylogenetic networks and argue that tree-based inference should not be blindly abandoned in favor of networks simply because they represent more parameter rich models. Attention should be given to model selection of reticulation complexity, and the most robust conclusions regarding evolutionary history are likely obtained when combining tree- and network-based inference.},

Here, we present a method - MetaPhlAn 4 - to integrate information from both metagenome assemblies and microbial isolate genomes for improved and more comprehensive metagenomic taxonomic profiling. From a curated collection of 1.01M prokaryotic reference and metagenome-assembled genomes, we defined unique marker genes for 26,970 species-level genome bins, 4,992 of them taxonomically unidentified at the species level. MetaPhlAn 4 explains {$\sim$}20\% more reads in most international human gut microbiomes and {$>$}40\% in less-characterized environments such as the rumen microbiome, and proved more accurate than available alternatives on synthetic evaluations while also reliably quantifying organisms with no cultured isolates. Application of the method to {$>$}24,500 metagenomes highlighted previously undetected species to be strong biomarkers for host conditions and lifestyles in human and mice microbiomes, and showed that even previously uncharacterized species can be genetically profiled at the resolution of single microbial strains. MetaPhlAn 4 thus integrates the novelty of metagenomic assemblies with the sensitivity and fidelity of reference-based analyses, providing efficient metagenomic profiling of uncharacterized species and enabling deeper and more comprehensive microbiome biomarker detection.},

A major field of application of such methods is, for example, the taxonomic identification of reads in metabarcoding or metagenomic studies. Several approaches to phylogenetic placement have been proposed in recent years. The most accurate of them require a multiple sequence alignment of the references as input. However, calculating multiple alignments is not only time consuming, but also limits the applicability of these approaches.                                         Results               Herein, we propose App-SpaM, an efficient algorithm for phylogenetic placement of short sequencing reads on a tree of a set of reference sequences. App-SpaM produces results of high quality that are on a par with the best available approaches to phylogenetic placement, while our software is two orders of magnitude faster than these existing methods. Our approach neither requires a multiple alignment of the reference sequences, nor alignments of the queries to the references. This enables App-SpaM to perform phylogenetic placement on a broad variety of data sets.                                         Availability               The source code of App-SpaM is freely available on Github at https://github.com/matthiasblanke/App-SpaM together with detailed instructions for installation and settings.

  abstract = {The diverse M{\"u}llerian mimetic wing patterns of neotropical               Heliconius               (Nymphalidae) have been proposed to be not only aposematic signals to potential predators, but also intra- and interspecific recognition signals that allow the butterflies to maintain their specific identities, and which perhaps drive the process of speciation, as well. Adaptive features under differential selection that also serve as cues for assortative mating have been referred to as `magic traits', which can drive ecological speciation. Such traits are expected to exhibit allelic differentiation between closely related species with ongoing gene flow, whereas unlinked neutral traits are expected to be homogenized to a greater degree by introgression. However, recent evidence suggests that interspecific hybridization among               Heliconius               butterflies may have resulted in adaptive introgression of these very same traits across species boundaries, and in the evolution of new species by homoploid hybrid speciation. The theory and data supporting various aspects of the apparent paradox of `magic trait' introgression are reviewed, with emphasis on population genomic comparisons of               Heliconius melpomene               and its close relatives.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               With growing genome-wide molecular datasets from next-generation sequencing, phylogenetic networks can be estimated using a variety of approaches. These phylogenetic networks include events like hybridization, gene flow or horizontal gene transfer explicitly. However, the most accurate network inference methods are computationally heavy. Methods that scale to larger datasets do not calculate a full likelihood, such that traditional likelihood-based tools for model selection are not applicable to decide how many past hybridization events best fit the data. We propose here a goodness-of-fit test to quantify the fit between data observed from genome-wide multi-locus data, and patterns expected under the multi-species coalescent model on a candidate phylogenetic network.                                         Results               We identified weaknesses in the previously proposed TICR test, and proposed corrections. The performance of our new test was validated by simulations on real-world phylogenetic networks. Our test provides one of the first rigorous tools for model selection, to select the adequate network complexity for the data at hand. The test can also work for identifying poorly inferred areas on a network.                                         Availability and implementation               Software for the goodness-of-fit test is available as a Julia package at https://github.com/cecileane/QuartetNetworkGoodnessFit.jl.

More precisely, we prove that the isomorphism problem for generic tree-sibling time consistent phylogenetic networks is polynomially equivalent to the graph isomorphism problem. Since the latter is believed not to belong to P, the chances are that it is impossible to define a metric on the class of all tree-sibling time consistent phylogenetic networks that can be computed in polynomial time.},

  abstract = {Reconstructing ancestral bacteria                            The origin of the eubacteria and phylogenetic relationships between subgroups have been difficult to resolve. Applying a phylogenetic analysis and recent computational methods to the expanded diversity of bacterial sequences from metagenomic analyses, Coleman               et al.               infer the root of the eubacterial tree (see the Perspective by Katz). The root was determined without using the Archaea as an outgroup, to avoid the possibility of a false result due to long branch attraction. This method places the eubacterial root in the neighborhood of Fusobacteriota. Using this information, the authors reconstructed the eubacterial ancestor, identifying that this organism likely had a double-membrane cell envelope, flagellum-mediated motility, antiphage defense mechanisms, and diverse metabolic pathways.                                         Science               , this issue p.               eabe0511               ; see also p.               574                        ,              A phylogenetic analysis models the evolution of 11,272 protein families in bacteria and identifies the likely evolutionary root.           ,                             INTRODUCTION               Bacteria are the most diverse and abundant cellular organisms on Earth, and in recent years environmental genomics has revealed the existence of an enormous diversity of previously unknown lineages. Despite the abundance of genomic sequence data, the root of the bacterial tree and the nature of the most recent common ancestor of Bacteria have remained elusive. The problem is that even with the help of new data, tracing billions of years of bacterial evolution back to the root has remained challenging because standard phylogenetic models do not account for the full range of evolutionary processes that shape bacterial genomes. In particular, standard models treat horizontal gene transfer as an impediment to the reconstruction of the tree of life that must be removed from analyses. But if horizontal gene transfer is modeled appropriately, it can provide information about the deep past that is unavailable to standard methods.                                         RATIONALE               We reconstructed and rooted the bacterial tree by applying a hierarchical phylogenomic approach that explicitly uses information from gene duplications and losses within a genome as well as gene transfers between genomes. This approach allowed us to root the tree without including an archaeal outgroup. Outgroup-free rooting is a promising approach for Bacteria, both because the position of the universal root is uncertain and because the long branch separating Bacteria from Archaea has the potential to distort the reconstruction of within-Bacteria relationships. Outgroup-free gene tree-species tree reconciliation allowed us to quantitatively model both the vertical and horizontal components of bacterial evolution and integrate information from 11,272 gene families to resolve the root of the bacterial tree. Notably, these analyses also provided estimates of the gene content of the last bacterial common ancestor.                                         RESULTS               Our analyses place the root between two major bacterial clades, the Gracilicutes and Terrabacteria. We found no support for a root between the Candidate Phyla Radiation (CPR), a lineage comprising putative symbionts and parasites with small genomes, and all other Bacteria. Instead, the CPR was inferred to be a member of the Terrabacteria and formed a sister lineage to the Chloroflexota and Dormibacterota. This suggests that the CPR evolved by reductive genome evolution from free-living ancestors. Gene families inferred to have been present at the root indicate that the last bacterial common ancestor was already a complex double-membraned cell capable of motility and chemotaxis that possessed a CRISPR-Cas system. Although {\textasciitilde}92\% of gene families have experienced horizontal transfers during their history, tracing their evolution along the most likely rooted tree revealed that about two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertical. Thus, bacterial evolution has a major vertical component, despite a profound impact of horizontal gene transfer through time. Horizontal gene flows can also provide insight into the temporal sequence of events during bacterial diversification, because donor lineages must be at least as old as recipients. Analysis of gene transfers in our dataset suggests that the diversification of the Firmicutes, CPR, Acidobacteriota, and Proteobacteria is the oldest among extant bacterial phyla.                                         CONCLUSION               The vertical and horizontal components of genome evolution provide complementary sources of information about bacterial phylogeny. The vertical component provides a robust framework for interpreting species diversity and allows us to reconstruct ancestral states, while the horizontal component helps to root the vertical tree and orient it in time. The inferred Gracilicutes-Terrabacteria root will be useful for investigating the tempo and mode of bacterial diversification, metabolic innovation, and changes in cell architecture such as the evolutionary transitions between double (diderm) and single (monoderm) membranes. Future development of methods that harness the complementarity of vertical and horizontal gene transmission will continue to further our understanding of life on Earth.                                                   A rooted phylogeny of Bacteria.                   The reconciliation of bacterial gene phylogenies places the root between the major clades of Gracilicutes (including Proteobacteria and Bacteroidota) and Terrabacteria (including Firmicutes and Cyanobacteria). On the basis of this hypothesis, ancestral genome reconstruction predicts that the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA) was a complex, double-membraned cell and that, on average, two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertically inherited along this rooted tree.                                                                         ,              A rooted bacterial tree is necessary to understand early evolution, but the position of the root is contested. Here, we model the evolution of 11,272 gene families to identify the root, extent of horizontal gene transfer (HGT), and the nature of the last bacterial common ancestor (LBCA). Our analyses root the tree between the major clades Terrabacteria and Gracilicutes and suggest that LBCA was a free-living flagellated, rod-shaped double-membraned organism. Contrary to recent proposals, our analyses reject a basal placement of the Candidate Phyla Radiation, which instead branches sister to Chloroflexota within Terrabacteria. While most gene families (92\%) have evidence of HGT, overall, two-thirds of gene transmissions have been vertical, suggesting that a rooted tree provides a meaningful frame of reference for interpreting bacterial evolution.},

  abstract = {Phylogenetic networks are leaf-labelled directed acyclic graphs that are used in computational biology to analyse and represent the evolutionary relationships of a set of species or viruses. In contrast to phylogenetic trees, phylogenetic networks have vertices of in-degree at least two that represent reticulation events such as hybridisation, lateral gene transfer, or reassortment. By systematically deleting various combinations of arcs in a phylogenetic network \${\textbackslash}mathcal N\$, one derives a set of phylogenetic trees that are embedded in \${\textbackslash}mathcal N\$. We recently showed that the problem of deciding if two binary phylogenetic networks embed the same set of phylogenetic trees is computationally hard, in particular, we showed it to be \${\textbackslash}Pi{\textasciicircum}P\_2\$-complete. In this paper, we establish a polynomial-time algorithm for this decision problem if the initial two networks consist of a normal network and a tree-child network; two well-studied topologically restricted subclasses of phylogenetic networks, with normal networks being more structurally constrained than tree-child networks. The running time of the algorithm is quadratic in the size of the leaf sets.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               In recent years, full-genome sequences have become increasingly available and as a result many modern phylogenetic analyses are based on very long sequences, often with over 100~000 sites. Phylogenetic reconstructions of large-scale alignments are challenging for likelihood-based phylogenetic inference programs and usually require using a powerful computer cluster. Current tools for alignment trimming prior to phylogenetic analysis do not promise a significant reduction in the alignment size and are claimed to have a negative effect on the accuracy of the obtained tree.                                         Results               Here, we propose an artificial-intelligence-based approach, which provides means to select the optimal subset of sites and a formula by which one can compute the log-likelihood of the entire data based on this subset. Our approach is based on training a regularized Lasso-regression model that optimizes the log-likelihood prediction accuracy while putting a constraint on the number of sites used for the approximation. We show that computing the likelihood based on 5\% of the sites already provides accurate approximation of the tree likelihood based on the entire data. Furthermore, we show that using this Lasso-based approximation during a tree search decreased running-time substantially while retaining the same tree-search performance.                                         Availability and implementation               The code was implemented in Python version 3.8 and is available through GitHub (https://github.com/noaeker/lasso\_positions\_sampling). The datasets used in this paper were retrieved from Zhou et al. (2018) as described in section 3.

  abstract = {Abstract             Recent analyses suggest that cross-species gene flow or introgression is common in nature, especially during species divergences. Genomic sequence data can be used to infer introgression events and to estimate the timing and intensity of introgression, providing an important means to advance our understanding of the role of gene flow in speciation. Here, we implement the multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression model, an extension of the multispecies-coalescent model to incorporate introgression, in our Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo program Bpp. The multispecies-coalescent-with-introgression model accommodates deep coalescence (or incomplete lineage sorting) and introgression and provides a natural framework for inference using genomic sequence data. Computer simulation confirms the good statistical properties of the method, although hundreds or thousands of loci are typically needed to estimate introgression probabilities reliably. Reanalysis of data sets from the purple cone spruce confirms the hypothesis of homoploid hybrid speciation. We estimated the introgression probability using the genomic sequence data from six mosquito species in the Anopheles gambiae species complex, which varies considerably across the genome, likely driven by differential selection against introgressed alleles.},

  abstract = {Abstract             We consider the evolution of phylogenetic gene trees along phylogenetic species networks, according to the network multispecies coalescent process, and introduce a new network coalescent model with correlated inheritance of gene flow. This model generalizes two traditional versions of the network coalescent: with independent or common inheritance. At each reticulation, multiple lineages of a given locus are inherited from parental populations chosen at random, either independently across lineages or with positive correlation according to a Dirichlet process. This process may account for locus-specific probabilities of inheritance, for example. We implemented the simulation of gene trees under these network coalescent models in the Julia package PhyloCoalSimulations, which depends on PhyloNetworks and its powerful network manipulation tools. Input species phylogenies can be read in extended Newick format, either in numbers of generations or in coalescent units. Simulated gene trees can be written in Newick format, and in a way that preserves information about their embedding within the species network. This embedding can be used for downstream purposes, such as to simulate species-specific processes like rate variation across species, or for other scenarios as illustrated in this note. This package should be useful for simulation studies and simulation-based inference methods. The software is available open source with documentation and a tutorial at https://github.com/cecileane/PhyloCoalSimulations.jl.},

The A and C types are found in significant proportions outside East Asia, that is, in Europeans and Americans. In contrast, the B type is the most common type in East Asia, and its ancestral genome appears not to have spread outside East Asia without first mutating into derived B types, pointing to founder effects or immunological or environmental resistance against this type outside Asia. The network faithfully traces routes of infections for documented coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases, indicating that phylogenetic networks can likewise be successfully used to help trace undocumented COVID-19 infection sources, which can then be quarantined to prevent recurrent spread of the disease worldwide.},

To detect hybridization from multi-locus and genome-wide sequence data, a popular class of methods are based on summary statistics from subsets of 3 or 4 taxa. However, these methods often carry the assumption of a constant substitution rate across lineages and genes, which is commonly broken in many groups. In this work, we quantify the effects of rate variation on the             D             -statistic (also known as ABBA-BABA test), the             D             3             statistic, and HyDe. All three tests are used widely across a range of taxonomic groups, in part because they are very fast to compute. We consider rate variation across species lineages, across genes, their lineage-by-gene interaction, and rate variation across gene-tree edges. We simulated species networks according to a birth-death-hybridization process so as to capture a range of realistic species phylogenies. For all three methods tested, we found a marked increase in the false discovery of reticulation (type-1 error rate) when there is rate variation across species lineages. The             D             3             statistic was the most sensitive, with around 80\% type-1 error, such that             D             3             appears to more sensitive to a departure from the clock than to the presence of reticulation. For all three tests, the power to detect hybridization events decreased as the number of hybridization events increased, indicating that multiple hybridization events can ``hide'' one another if they occur within a small subset of taxa. Our study highlights the need to consider rate variation when using site-based summary statistics, and points to the advantages of methods that do not require assumptions on evolutionary rates across lineages or across genes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             The taxonomy of North American crayfishes has recently experienced a boom in interest as these crustaceans have become increasingly imperiled. Improving taxonomic resolution can inform and facilitate conservation efforts but has proven challenging for crayfishes due to the limited number of molecular tools available to resolve species complexes and delimit species. The burrowing crayfish LacunicambarusHobbs, 1969 has a particularly convoluted taxonomic history that epitomizes many of the challenges of crayfish taxonomy. Recent studies using mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data to resolve this genus have had mixed results: mtDNA data have successfully resolved species-clades within Lacunicambarus but have failed to resolve interspecific relationships. This has precluded research on evolutionary history and biogeography. Our goal was to resolve the phylogeny of Lacunicambarus using anchored hybrid enrichment (AHE) data, a new source of additional molecular markers for estimating phylogenetic relationships. We present the best resolved phylogeny for Lacunicambarus to date and explore discrepancies between this phylogeny and past ones based on mtDNA data. We use this new phylogeny to explore interspecific relationships within Lacunicambarus and redescribe L. erythrodactylus (Simon \& Morris, 2014) and L. nebrascensis (Girard, 1852) comb. nov. Our study demonstrates the tremendous contributions that next-generation sequencing methods like AHE can make to crayfish taxonomy and conservation.},

  abstract = {A phylogenetic network is a generalization of a phylogenetic tree, allowing structural properties that are not tree-like. With the growth of genomic data, much of which does not fit ideal tree models, there is greater need to understand the algorithmics and combinatorics of phylogenetic networks [10, 11]. However, to date, very little has been published on this, with the notable exception of the paper by Wang et al.[12]. Other related papers include [4, 5, 7] We consider the problem introduced in [12], of determining whether the sequences can be derived on a phylogenetic network where the recombination cycles are node disjoint. In this paper, we call such a phylogenetic network a "galled-tree". By more deeply analysing the combinatorial constraints on cycle-disjoint phylogenetic networks, we obtain an efficient algorithm that is guaranteed to be both a necessary and sufficient test for the existence of a galled-tree for the data. If there is a galled-tree, the algorithm constructs one and obtains an implicit representation of all the galled trees for the data, and can create these in linear time for each one. We also note two additional results related to galled trees: first, any set of sequences that can be derived on a galled tree can be derived on a true tree (without recombination cycles), where at most one back mutation is allowed per site; second, the site compatibility problem (which is NP-hard in general) can be solved in linear time for any set of sequences that can be derived on a galled tree. The combinatorial constraints we develop apply (for the most part) to node-disjoint cycles in any phylogenetic network (not just galled-trees), and can be used for example to prove that a given site cannot be on a node-disjoint cycle in any phylogenetic network. Perhaps more important than the specific results about galled-trees, we introduce an approach that can be used to study recombination in phylogenetic networks that go beyond galled-trees.},

The objective is to recover the epidemic transmission tree, which identifies who infected whom. This paper reviews the various approaches that have been taken. The first step is to define a measure of difference between sequences, which must be done while taking into account such factors as recombination and convergent evolution. Three broad categories of method exist, of increasing complexity: those that assume no withinhost genetic diversity or mutation, those that assume no within-host diversity but allow mutation, and those that allow both. Until recently, the assumption was usually made that every host in the epidemic could be identified, but this is now being relaxed, and some methods are intended for sparsely sampled data, concentrating on the identification of pairs of sequences that are likely to be the result of direct transmission rather than inferring the complete transmission tree.

  abstract = {Abstract           Methods based on the multi-species coalescence have been widely used in phylogenetic tree estimation using genome-scale DNA sequence data to understand the underlying evolutionary relationship between the sampled species. Evolutionary processes such as hybridization, which creates new species through interbreeding between two different species, necessitate inferring a species network instead of a species tree. A species tree is strictly bifurcating and thus fails to incorporate hybridization events which require an internal node of degree three. Hence, it is crucial to decide whether a tree or network analysis should be performed given a DNA sequence data set, a decision that is based on the presence of hybrid species in the sampled species. Although many methods have been proposed for hybridization detection, it is rare to find a technique that does so globally while considering a data generation mechanism that allows both hybridization and incomplete lineage sorting. In this paper, we consider hybridization and coalescence in a unified framework and propose a new test that can detect whether there are any hybrid species in a given set of species. We propose that based on this global test of hybridization, one can decide whether a tree or network analysis is appropriate for a given data set.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Introgression creates complex, non-bifurcating relationships among species. At individual loci and across the genome, both introgression and incomplete lineage sorting interact to produce a wide range of different gene tree topologies. These processes can obscure the history of speciation among lineages, and, as a result, identifying the history of speciation vs. introgression remains a challenge. Here, we use theory and simulation to investigate how introgression can mislead multiple approaches to species tree inference. We find that arbitrarily low amounts of introgression can mislead both gene tree methods and parsimony methods if the rate of incomplete lineage sorting is sufficiently high. We also show that an alternative approach based on minimum gene tree node heights is inconsistent and depends on the rate of introgression across the genome. To distinguish between speciation and introgression, we apply supervised machine learning models to a set of features that can easily be obtained from phylogenomic datasets. We find that multiple of these models are highly accurate in classifying the species history in simulated datasets. We also show that, if the histories of speciation and introgression can be identified,             PhyloNet             will return highly accurate estimates of the contribution of each history to the data (i.e. edge weights). Overall, our results highlight the promise of supervised machine learning as a potentially powerful complement to phylogenetic methods in the analysis of introgression from genomic data.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Molecular phylogenies have yielded strong support for many parts of the amphibian Tree of Life, but poor support for the resolution of deeper nodes, including relationships among families and orders. To clarify these relationships, we provide a phylogenomic perspective on amphibian relationships by developing a taxon-specific Anchored Hybrid Enrichment protocol targeting hundreds of conserved exons which are effective across the class. After obtaining data from 220 loci for 286 species (representing 94\% of the families and 44\% of the genera), we estimate a phylogeny for extant amphibians and identify gene tree--species tree conflict across the deepest branches of the amphibian phylogeny. We perform locus-by-locus genealogical interrogation of alternative topological hypotheses for amphibian monophyly, focusing on interordinal relationships. We find that phylogenetic signal deep in the amphibian phylogeny varies greatly across loci in a manner that is consistent with incomplete lineage sorting in the ancestral lineage of extant amphibians. Our results overwhelmingly support amphibian monophyly and a sister relationship between frogs and salamanders, consistent with the Batrachia hypothesis. Species tree analyses converge on a small set of topological hypotheses for the relationships among extant amphibian families. These results clarify several contentious portions of the amphibian Tree of Life, which in conjunction with a set of vetted fossil calibrations, support a surprisingly younger timescale for crown and ordinal amphibian diversification than previously reported. More broadly, our study provides insight into the sources, magnitudes, and heterogeneity of support across loci in phylogenomic data sets.[AIC; Amphibia; Batrachia; Phylogeny; gene tree--species tree discordance; genomics; information theory.]},

Beginning with a concise introduction to both phylogenetic trees and phylogenetic networks, the fundamental concepts and results are then presented for both rooted and unrooted phylogenetic networks. Current approaches and algorithms available for computing phylogenetic networks from different types of datasets are then discussed, accompanied by examples of their application to real biological datasets. The book also summarises the algorithms used for drawing phylogenetic networks, along with the existing software for their computation and evaluation.

For example, they assume single-gene data (e.g., 16S rRNA amplicons) have evolved under the GTR model on a gene tree. Placement, however, often has a more ambitious goal: extending a (genome-wide) species tree given data from individual genes without knowing the evolutionary model. Addressing this challenging problem requires new directions. Here, we introduce Deep-learning Enabled Phylogenetic Placement (DEPP), an algorithm that learns to extend species trees using single genes without prespecified models. In simulations and on real data, we show that DEPP can match the accuracy of model-based methods without any prior knowledge of the model. We also show that DEPP can update the multilocus microbial tree-of-life with single genes with high accuracy. We further demonstrate that DEPP can combine 16S and metagenomic data onto a single tree, enabling community structure analyses that take advantage of both sources of data.

The many mechanisms that contribute to gene flow (e.g. introgression, hybridization, lateral gene transfer) uniquely affect the diversification of dynamics of species, making it important to be able to account for these idiosyncrasies when constructing phylogenetic models. Existing phylogenetic-network simulators for macroevolution are limited in the ways they model gene flow.

Specifically, we model different reticulate events by allowing events to either add, remove or keep constant the number of lineages. Additionally, we allow reticulation events to be trait dependent, creating the ability to model the expanse of isolating mechanisms that prevent gene flow. This tool makes it possible for researchers to model many of the complex biological factors associated with gene flow in a phylogenetic context.},

We report a comparative study of consensus, maximum parsimony, and maximum likelihood methods of species network reconstruction using gene trees simulated assuming a known species history. We evaluate the role of the divergence time between species involved in a hybridization event, the relative contributions of the hybridizing species, and the error in gene tree estimation. When gene tree discordance is mostly due to hybridization and not due to incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), most of the methods can detect even highly skewed hybridization events between highly divergent species. For recent divergences between hybridizing species, when the influence of ILS is sufficiently high, likelihood methods outperform parsimony and consensus methods, which erroneously identify extra hybridizations. The more sophisticated likelihood methods, however, are affected by gene tree errors to a greater extent than are consensus and parsimony.},

The DNA record confirms the presence of hare and mitochondrial DNA from animals including mastodons, reindeer, rodents and geese, all ancestral to their present-day and late Pleistocene relatives. The presence of marine species including horseshoe crab and green algae support a warmer climate than today. The reconstructed ecosystem has no modern analogue. The survival of such ancient eDNA probably relates to its binding to mineral surfaces. Our findings open new areas of genetic research, demonstrating that it is possible to track the ecology and evolution of biological communities from two million years ago using ancient eDNA.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Interspecific hybridization is an important evolutionary phenomenon that generates genetic variability in a population and fosters species diversity in nature. The availability of large genome scale data sets has revolutionized hybridization studies to shift from the observation of the presence or absence of hybrids to the investigation of the genomic constitution of hybrids and their genome-specific evolutionary dynamics. Although a handful of methods have been proposed in an attempt to identify hybrids, accurate detection of hybridization from genomic data remains a challenging task. In addition to methods that infer phylogenetic networks or that utilize pairwise divergence, site pattern frequency based and population genetic clustering approaches are popularly used in practice, though the performance of these methods under different hybridization scenarios has not been extensively examined. Here, we use simulated data to comparatively evaluate the performance of four tools that are commonly used to infer hybridization events: the site pattern frequency based methods HyDe and the \$D\$-statistic (i.e., the ABBA-BABA test) and the population clustering approaches structure and ADMIXTURE. We consider single hybridization scenarios that vary in the time of hybridization and the amount of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) for different proportions of parental contributions (\${\textbackslash}gamma\$); introgressive hybridization; multiple hybridization scenarios; and a mixture of ancestral and recent hybridization scenarios. We focus on the statistical power to detect hybridization and the false discovery rate (FDR) for comparisons of the \$D\$-statistic and HyDe, and the accuracy of the estimates of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ as measured by the mean squared error for HyDe, structure, and ADMIXTURE. Both HyDe and the \$D\$-statistic are powerful for detecting hybridization in all scenarios except those with high ILS, although the \$D\$-statistic often has an unacceptably high FDR. The estimates of \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ in HyDe are impressively robust and accurate whereas structure and ADMIXTURE sometimes fail to identify hybrids, particularly when the proportional parental contributions are asymmetric (i.e., when \${\textbackslash}gamma\$ is close to 0). Moreover, the posterior distribution estimated using structure exhibits multimodality in many scenarios, making interpretation difficult. Our results provide guidance in selecting appropriate methods for identifying hybrid populations from genomic data.

However, due to reticulate processes such as hybridization or lateral gene transfer, evolution cannot always be adequately represented by a phylogenetic tree, and rooted phylogenetic networks that describe such complex processes have been introduced as a generalization of rooted phylogenetic trees. In fact, estimating rooted phylogenetic networks from genomic sequence data and analyzing their structural properties is one of the most important tasks in contemporary phylogenetics. Over the last two decades, several subclasses of rooted phylogenetic networks (characterized by certain structural constraints) have been introduced in the literature, either to model specific biological phenomena or to enable tractable mathematical and computational analyses. In the present manuscript, we provide a thorough review of these network classes, as well as provide a biological interpretation of the structural constraints underlying these networks where possible. In addition, we discuss how imposing structural constraints on the network topology can be used to address the scalability and identifiability challenges faced in the estimation of phylogenetic networks from empirical data.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        While phylogenies have been essential in understanding how species evolve, they do not adequately describe some evolutionary processes. For instance, hybridization, a common phenomenon where interbreeding between two species leads to formation of a new species, must be depicted by a phylogenetic network, a structure that modifies a phylogeny by allowing two branches to merge into one, resulting in reticulation. However, existing methods for estimating networks are computationally expensive as the dataset size and/or topological complexity increase. The lack of methods for scalable inference hampers phylogenetic networks from being widely used in practice, despite accumulating evidence that hybridization occurs frequently in nature. Here, we propose a novel method, PhyNEST (Phylogenetic Network Estimation using SiTe patterns), that estimates phylogenetic networks directly from sequence data. PhyNEST achieves computational efficiency by using composite likelihood as well as accuracy by using the full genomic data to incorporate all sources of variability, rather than first summarizing the data by estimating a set of gene trees, as is required by most of the existing methods. To efficiently search network space, we implement both hill-climbing and simulated annealing algorithms. Simulation studies show that PhyNEST can accurately estimate parameters given the true network topology and that it has comparable accuracy to two popular methods that use composite likelihood and a set of gene trees as input, implemented in SNaQ and PhyloNet. For datasets with a large number of loci, PhyNEST is more efficient than SNaQ and PhyloNet when considering the time required for gene tree estimation. We applied PhyNEST to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among             Heliconius             butterflies and Papionini primates, characterized by hybrid speciation and widespread introgression, respectively. PhyNEST is implemented in an open-source Julia package and publicly available at             https://github.com/sungsik-kong/PhyNEST.jl             .},

  abstract = {Gene duplication is an important evolutionary mechanism allowing to provide new genetic material and thus opportunities to acquire new gene functions for an organism, with major implications such as speciation events. Various processes are known to allow a gene to be duplicated and different models explain how duplicated genes can be maintained in genomes. Due to their particular importance, the identification of duplicated genes is essential when studying genome evolution but it can still be a challenge due to the various fates duplicated genes can encounter. In this review, we first describe the evolutionary processes allowing the formation of duplicated genes but also describe the various bioinformatic approaches that can be used to identify them in genome sequences. Indeed, these bioinformatic approaches differ according to the underlying duplication mechanism. Hence, understanding the specificity of the duplicated genes of interest is a great asset for tool selection and should be taken into account when exploring a biological question.},

Most commonly, it is assumed that natural selection separates species originating from a single population on the basis of variation in traits that confer advantages for survival and reproduction. Lamichhaney               et al.               document a case where cross-species hybridization established a reproductively isolated lineage, which demonstrates a process known as homoploid hybrid speciation in action (see the Perspective by Wagner). The authors used genetic markers and phenotypic analyses to create a pedigree that revealed how a cross-island migrant bred with a native species to form a self-perpetuating hybrid population that was reproductively isolated from both parental species.

Here we report a directly documented example, from its origin to reproductive isolation. An immigrant Darwin's finch to Daphne Major in the Gal{\'a}pagos archipelago initiated a new genetic lineage by breeding with a resident finch (               Geospiza fortis               ). Genome sequencing of the immigrant identified it as a               G. conirostris               male that originated on Espa{\~n}ola {$>$}100 kilometers from Daphne Major. From the second generation onward, the lineage bred endogamously and, despite intense inbreeding, was ecologically successful and showed transgressive segregation of bill morphology. This example shows that reproductive isolation, which typically develops over hundreds of generations, can be established in only three.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             The practice of classifying organisms into hierarchical groups originated with Aristotle and was codified into nearly immutable biological law by Linnaeus. The heart of taxonomy is the biological species, which forms the foundation for higher levels of classification. Whereas species have long been established among sexual eukaryotes, achieving a meaningful species concept for prokaryotes has been an onerous task and has proven exceedingly difficult for describing viruses and bacteriophages. Moreover, the assembly of viral ``species'' into higher-order taxonomic groupings has been even more tenuous, since these groupings were based initially on limited numbers of morphological features and more recently on overall genomic similarities. The wealth of nucleotide sequence information that catalyzed a revolution in the taxonomy of free-living organisms necessitates a reevaluation of the concept of viral species, genera, families, and higher levels of classification. Just as microbiologists discarded dubious morphological traits in favor of more accurate molecular yardsticks of evolutionary change, virologists can gain new insight into viral evolution through the rigorous analyses afforded by the molecular phylogenetics of viral genes. For bacteriophages, such dissections of genomic sequences reveal fundamental flaws in the Linnaean paradigm that necessitate a new view of viral evolution, classification, and taxonomy.},

The data revealed two superspreading events. One, in a skilled nursing facility, led to rapid transmission and significant mortality in this vulnerable population but little broader spread, whereas other introductions into the facility had little effect. The second, at an international business conference, produced sustained community transmission and was exported, resulting in extensive regional, national, and international spread. The two events also differed substantially in the genetic variation they generated, suggesting varying transmission dynamics in superspreading events. Our results show how genomic epidemiology can help to understand the link between individual clusters and wider community spread.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Taxonomic classification is at the core of environmental DNA analysis. When a phylogenetic tree can be built as a prior hypothesis to such classification, phylogenetic placement (PP) provides the most informative type of classification because each query sequence is assigned to its putative origin in the tree. This is useful whenever precision is sought (e.g. in diagnostics). However, likelihood-based PP algorithms struggle to scale with the ever-increasing throughput of DNA sequencing.                                         Results               We have developed RAPPAS (Rapid Alignment-free Phylogenetic Placement via Ancestral Sequences) which uses an alignment-free approach, removing the hurdle of query sequence alignment as a preliminary step to PP. Our approach relies on the precomputation of a database of k-mers that may be present with non-negligible probability in relatives of the reference sequences. The placement is performed by inspecting the stored phylogenetic origins of the k-mers in the query, and their probabilities. The database can be reused for the analysis of several different metagenomes. Experiments show that the first implementation of RAPPAS is already faster than competing likelihood-based PP algorithms, while keeping similar accuracy for short reads. RAPPAS scales PP for the era of routine metagenomic diagnostics.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               A major goal of metagenomics is to characterize the microbial composition of an environment. The most popular approach relies on 16S rRNA sequencing, however this approach can generate biased estimates due to differences in the copy number of the gene between even closely related organisms, and due to PCR artifacts. The taxonomic composition can also be determined from metagenomic shotgun sequencing data by matching individual reads against a database of reference sequences. One major limitation of prior computational methods used for this purpose is the use of a universal classification threshold for all genes at all taxonomic levels.                                         Results                                We propose that better classification results can be obtained by tuning the taxonomic classifier to each matching length, reference gene, and taxonomic level. We present a novel taxonomic classifier MetaPhyler (                 http://metaphyler.cbcb.umd.edu                 ), which uses phylogenetic marker genes as a taxonomic reference. Results on simulated datasets demonstrate that MetaPhyler outperforms other tools commonly used in this context (CARMA, Megan and PhymmBL). We also present interesting results by analyzing a real metagenomic dataset.                                                        Conclusions               We have introduced a novel taxonomic classification method for analyzing the microbial diversity from whole-metagenome shotgun sequences. Compared with previous approaches, MetaPhyler is much more accurate in estimating the phylogenetic composition. In addition, we have shown that MetaPhyler can be used to guide the discovery of novel organisms from metagenomic samples.},

Traditional multiple sequence alignment methods disregard the phylogenetic implications of gap patterns that they create and infer systematically biased alignments with excess deletions and substitutions, too few insertions, and implausible insertion-deletion--event histories. We present a method that prevents these systematic errors by recognizing insertions and deletions as distinct evolutionary events. We show theoretically and practically that this improves the quality of sequence alignments and downstream analyses over a wide range of realistic alignment problems. These results suggest that insertions and sequence turnover are more common than is currently thought and challenge the conventional picture of sequence evolution and mechanisms of functional and structural changes.},

Current, actively developed approaches for phylogenetic network inference jointly account for non-treelike evolution and incomplete lineage sorting (ILS). Unfortunately, this induces a very high computational complexity and current tools can only analyze small datasets.                                         Results               We present NetRAX, a tool for maximum likelihood (ML) inference of phylogenetic networks in the absence of ILS. Our tool leverages state-of-the-art methods for efficiently computing the phylogenetic likelihood function on trees, and extends them to phylogenetic networks via the notion of `displayed trees'. NetRAX can infer ML phylogenetic networks from partitioned multiple sequence alignments and returns the inferred networks in Extended Newick format. On simulated data, our results show a very low relative difference in Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) score and a near-zero unrooted softwired cluster distance to the true, simulated networks. With NetRAX, a network inference on a partitioned alignment with 8000 sites, 30 taxa and 3 reticulations completes within a few minutes on a standard laptop.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               A phylogenetic network is a powerful model to represent entangled evolutionary histories with both divergent (speciation) and convergent (e.g. hybridization, reassortment, recombination) evolution. The standard approach to inference of hybridization networks is to (i) reconstruct rooted gene trees and (ii) leverage gene tree discordance for network inference. Recently, we introduced a method called RF-Net for accurate inference of virus reassortment and hybridization networks from input gene trees in the presence of errors commonly found in phylogenetic trees. While RF-Net demonstrated the ability to accurately infer networks with up to four reticulations from erroneous input gene trees, its application was limited by the number of reticulations it could handle in a reasonable amount of time. This limitation is particularly restrictive in the inference of the evolutionary history of segmented RNA viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), where reassortment is one of the major mechanisms shaping the evolution of these pathogens.                                         Results               Here, we expand the functionality of RF-Net that makes it significantly more applicable in practice. Crucially, we introduce a fast extension to RF-Net, called Fast-RF-Net, that can handle large numbers of reticulations without sacrificing accuracy. In addition, we develop automatic stopping criteria to select the appropriate number of reticulations heuristically and implement a feature for RF-Net to output error-corrected input gene trees. We then conduct a comprehensive study of the original method and its novel extensions and confirm their efficacy in practice using extensive simulation and empirical IAV evolutionary analyses.

  abstract = {Most speciation events probably occur gradually, without complete and immediate reproductive isolation, but the full extent of gene flow between diverging species has rarely been characterized on a genome-wide scale. Documenting the extent and timing of admixture between diverging species can clarify the role of geographic isolation in speciation. Here we use new methodology to quantify admixture at different stages of divergence in               Heliconius               butterflies, based on whole-genome sequences of 31 individuals. Comparisons between sympatric and allopatric populations of               H. melpomene               ,               H. cydno               , and               H. timareta               revealed a genome-wide trend of increased shared variation in sympatry, indicative of pervasive interspecific gene flow. Up to 40\% of 100-kb genomic windows clustered by geography rather than by species, demonstrating that a very substantial fraction of the genome has been shared between sympatric species. Analyses of genetic variation shared over different time intervals suggested that admixture between these species has continued since early in speciation. Alleles shared between species during recent time intervals displayed higher levels of linkage disequilibrium than those shared over longer time intervals, suggesting that this admixture took place at multiple points during divergence and is probably ongoing. The signal of admixture was significantly reduced around loci controlling divergent wing patterns, as well as throughout the Z chromosome, consistent with strong selection for M{\"u}llerian mimicry and with known Z-linked hybrid incompatibility. Overall these results show that species divergence can occur in the face of persistent and genome-wide admixture over long periods of time.},

Whereas the MSC explicitly assumes genealogies to be unlinked, i.e., statistically independent, genealogies located close together on genomes are spatially auto-correlated. Here we use tree sequence simulations with recombination to explore the effects of species tree parameters on spatial patterns of linkage among genealogies. We decompose coalescent time units to demonstrate differential effects of generation time and effective population size on spatial coalescent patterns, and we define a new metric, ``phylogenetic linkage,'' for measuring the rate of decay of phylogenetic similarity by comparison to distances among unlinked genealogies. Finally, we provide a simple example where accounting for phylogenetic linkage in sliding window analyses improves local gene tree inference.},

However, the dependency of most methods on reference genomes, which are currently unavailable for a substantial fraction of microbial species, introduces estimation biases. We present an updated and functionally extended tool based on universal (i.e., reference-independent), phylogenetic marker gene (MG)-based operational taxonomic units (mOTUs) enabling the profiling of {$>$}7700 microbial species. As more than 30\% of them could not previously be quantified at this taxonomic resolution, relative abundance estimates based on mOTUs are more accurate compared to other methods. As a new feature, we show that mOTUs, which are based on essential housekeeping genes, are demonstrably well-suited for quantification of basal transcriptional activity of community members. Furthermore, single nucleotide variation profiles estimated using mOTUs reflect those from whole genomes, which allows for comparing microbial strain populations (e.g., across different human body sites).},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Inference of genetic clusters is a key aim of population genetics, sparking development of numerous analytical methods. Within these, there is a conceptual divide between finding de novo structure versus assessment of a priori groups. Recently developed, Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), combines discriminant analysis (DA) with principal component (PC) analysis. When applying DAPC, the groups used in the DA (specified a priori or described de novo) need to be carefully assessed. While DAPC has rapidly become a core technique, the sensitivity of the method to misspecification of groups and how it is being empirically applied, are unknown. To address this, we conducted a simulation study examining the influence of a priori versus de novo group designations, and a literature review of how DAPC is being applied. We found that with a priori groupings, distance between genetic clusters reflected underlying               F               ST               . However, when migration rates were high and groups were described de novo there was considerable inaccuracy, both in terms of the number of genetic clusters suggested and placement of individuals into those clusters. Nearly all (90.1\%) of 224 studies surveyed used DAPC to find de novo clusters, and for the majority (62.5\%) the stated goal matched the results. However, most studies (52.3\%) omit key run parameters, preventing repeatability and transparency. Therefore, we present recommendations for standard reporting of parameters used in DAPC analyses. The influence of groupings in genetic clustering is not unique to DAPC, and researchers need to consider their goal and which methods will be most appropriate.},

Results               We present FastMulRFS, a polynomial-time method for estimating species trees without knowledge of orthology. We prove that FastMulRFS is statistically consistent under a generic model of GDL when adversarial GDL does not occur. Our extensive simulation study shows that FastMulRFS matches the accuracy of MulRF (which tries to solve the same optimization problem) and has better accuracy than prior methods, including ASTRAL-multi (the only method to date that has been proven statistically consistent under GDL), while being much faster than both methods.                                         Availability and impementation               FastMulRFS is available on Github (https://github.com/ekmolloy/fastmulrfs).

  abstract = {Abstract             Gene tree discordance in large genomic data sets can be caused by evolutionary processes such as incomplete lineage sorting and hybridization, as well as model violation, and errors in data processing, orthology inference, and gene tree estimation. Species tree methods that identify and accommodate all sources of conflict are not available, but a combination of multiple approaches can help tease apart alternative sources of conflict. Here, using a phylotranscriptomic analysis in combination with reference genomes, we test a hypothesis of ancient hybridization events within the plant family Amaranthaceae s.l. that was previously supported by morphological, ecological, and Sanger-based molecular data. The data set included seven genomes and 88 transcriptomes, 17 generated for this study. We examined gene-tree discordance using coalescent-based species trees and network inference, gene tree discordance analyses, site pattern tests of introgression, topology tests, synteny analyses, and simulations. We found that a combination of processes might have generated the high levels of gene tree discordance in the backbone of Amaranthaceae s.l. Furthermore, we found evidence that three consecutive short internal branches produce anomalous trees contributing to the discordance. Overall, our results suggest that Amaranthaceae s.l. might be a product of an ancient and rapid lineage diversification, and remains, and probably will remain, unresolved. This work highlights the potential problems of identifiability associated with the sources of gene tree discordance including, in particular, phylogenetic network methods. Our results also demonstrate the importance of thoroughly testing for multiple sources of conflict in phylogenomic analyses, especially in the context of ancient, rapid radiations. We provide several recommendations for exploring conflicting signals in such situations.

  abstract = {Abstract             In phylogenetic inference, we commonly use models of substitution which assume that sequence evolution is stationary, reversible, and homogeneous (SRH). Although the use of such models is often criticized, the extent of SRH violations and their effects on phylogenetic inference of tree topologies and edge lengths are not well understood. Here, we introduce and apply the maximal matched-pairs tests of homogeneity to assess the scale and impact of SRH model violations on 3,572 partitions from 35 published phylogenetic data sets. We show that roughly one-quarter of all the partitions we analyzed (23.5\%) reject the SRH assumptions, and that for 25\% of data sets, tree topologies inferred from all partitions differ significantly from topologies inferred using the subset of partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. This proportion increases when comparing trees inferred using the subset of partitions that rejects the SRH assumptions, to those inferred from partitions that do not reject the SRH assumptions. These results suggest that the extent and effects of model violation in phylogenetics may be substantial. They highlight the importance of testing for model violations and possibly excluding partitions that violate models prior to tree reconstruction. Our results also suggest that further effort in developing models that do not require SRH assumptions could lead to large improvements in the accuracy of phylogenomic inference. The scripts necessary to perform the analysis are available in https://github.com/roblanf/SRHtests, and the new tests we describe are available as a new option in IQ-TREE (http://www.iqtree.org).},

For the troponin C family, at the period of differentiation of the fast and slow isoforms, amino acid substitutions were shown to have been accelerated relative to synonymous substitutions. Comparison of the first exon of alpha-actin genes revealed that amino acid substitutions were accelerated when the smooth muscle, skeletal and cardiac isoforms differentiated. Analysis of members of the heat shock protein 70 gene family of mammals indicates that heat shock responsive genes including duplicated copies are evolving rapidly, contrary to the cognitive genes which have been evolutionarily conservative. For the alpha 1-antitrypsin reactive center, the acceleration of amino acid substitution has been found for gene paris of recent duplication.},

  abstract = {Abstract The Midas cichlids of the Amphilophus citrinellus spp. species complex from Nicaragua (13 species) are an extraordinary example of adaptive and rapid radiation (\&lt; 24,000 years old). These cichlids are a very challenging group to infer its evolutionary history in phylogenetic analyses, due to the apparent prevalence of incomplete lineage sorting (ILS), as well as past and current gene flow. Assuming solely a vertical transfer of genetic material from an ancestral lineage to new lineages is not appropriate in many cases of genes transferred horizontally in nature. Recently developed methods to infer phylogenetic networks under such circumstances might be able to circumvent these problems. These models accommodate not just ILS, but also gene flow, under the multispecies network coalescent model (MSNC), processes that are at work in young, hybridizing, and/or rapidly diversifying lineages. There are currently only a few programs available that implement MSNC for estimating phylogenetic networks. Here, we present a novel way to incorporate single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data into the currently available PhyloNetworks program. Based on simulations, we demonstrate that SNPs can provide enough power to recover the true phylogenetic network. We also show that it can accurately infer the true network more often than other similar SNP-based programs (PhyloNet and HyDe). Moreover, our approach results in a faster algorithm compared to the original pipeline in PhyloNetworks, without losing power. We also applied our new approach to infer the phylogenetic network of Midas cichlid radiation. We implemented the most comprehensive genomic dataset to date (RADseq dataset of 679 individuals and \&gt;37K SNPs from 19 ingroup lineages) and present estimated phylogenetic networks for this extremely young and fast-evolving radiation of cichlid fish. We demonstrate that the MSNC is more appropriate than the multispecies coalescent alone for the analysis of this rapid radiation.}

Recently, Nakhleh and co-workers extended this criterion to enable reconstruction of                 phylogenetic networks                 , and demonstrated its application to detecting reticulate evolutionary relationships. However, one of the major problems with this extension has been that it favors more complex evolutionary relationships over simpler ones, thus having the potential for overestimating the amount of reticulation in the data. An                 ad hoc                 solution to this problem that has been used entails inspecting the improvement in the parsimony length as more reticulation events are added to the model, and stopping when the improvement is below a certain threshold.                                                        Results               In this paper, we address this problem in a more systematic way, by proposing a nonparametric bootstrap-based measure of support of inferred reticulation events, and using it to determine the number of those events, as well as their placements. A number of samples is generated from the given sequence alignment, and reticulation events are inferred based on each sample. Finally, the support of each reticulation event is quantified based on the inferences made over all samples.                                         Conclusions                                We have implemented our method in the NEPAL software tool (available publicly at                 http://bioinfo.cs.rice.edu/                 ), and studied its performance on both biological and simulated data sets. While our studies show very promising results, they also highlight issues that are inherently challenging when applying the maximum parsimony criterion to detect reticulate evolution.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Evolutionary biologists want to explain the origin of novel features and functions. Two recent but separate lines of research address this question. The first describes one possible outcome of hybridization, called transgressive segregation, where hybrid offspring exhibit trait distributions outside of the parental range. The second considers the explicit mapping of form to function and illustrates manifold paths to similar function (called many to one mapping, MTOM) when the relationship between the two is complex. Under this scenario, functional novelty may be a product of the number of ways to elicit a functional outcome (i.e., the degree of MTOM). We fuse these research themes by considering the influence of MTOM on the production of transgressive jaw biomechanics in simulated hybrids between Lake Malawi cichlid species.                                         Results                                We characterized the component links and functional output (kinematic transmission, KT) of the 4-bar mechanism in the oral jaws of Lake Malawi cichlids. We demonstrated that the input and output links, the length of the lower jaw and the length of the maxilla respectively, have consistent but opposing relationships with KT. Based on these data, we predicted scenarios in which species with different morphologies but similar KT (MTOM species) would produce transgressive function in hybrids. We used a simple but realistic genetic model to show that transgressive function is a likely outcome of hybridization among Malawi species exhibiting MTOM. Notably, F                 2                 hybrids are transgressive for function (KT), but not the component links that contribute to function. In our model, transgression is a consequence of recombination and assortment among alleles specifying the lengths of the lower jaw and maxilla.                                                        Conclusion               We have described a general and likely pervasive mechanism that generates functional novelty. Simulations of hybrid offspring among Lake Malawi cichlids exhibiting MTOM produce transgressive function in the majority of cases, and at appreciable frequency. Functional transgression (i) is a product of recombination and assortment between alleles controlling the lengths of the lower jaw and the maxilla, (ii) occurs in the absence of transgressive morphology, and (iii) can be predicted from the morphology of parents. Our genetic model can be tested by breeding Malawi cichlid hybrids in the laboratory and examining the resulting range of forms and functions.},

We present a suite of methods for learning about population mixtures, implemented in a software package called ADMIXTOOLS, that support formal tests for whether mixture occurred and make it possible to infer proportions and dates of mixture. We also describe the development of a new single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array consisting of 629,433 sites with clearly documented ascertainment that was specifically designed for population genetic analyses and that we genotyped in 934 individuals from 53 diverse populations. To illustrate the methods, we give a number of examples that provide new insights about the history of human admixture. The most striking finding is a clear signal of admixture into northern Europe, with one ancestral population related to present-day Basques and Sardinians and the other related to present-day populations of northeast Asia and the Americas. This likely reflects a history of admixture between Neolithic migrants and the indigenous Mesolithic population of Europe, consistent with recent analyses of ancient bones from Sweden and the sequencing of the genome of the Tyrolean ``Iceman.''},

Here, we propose a new method for detecting hybridization and quantifying the extent of hybridization. Our test computes the likelihood of a species tree that is possibly subject to hybridization using site pattern frequencies from genomic-scale datasets under the multispecies coalescent. To do this, we extend the calculation of the likelihood for site pattern frequency data for the 4-taxon symmetric and asymmetric species trees proposed in Chifman and Kubatko (2015) by incorporating an inheritance parameter, resulting in efficient computation of the likelihood under a scenario of hybridization. We use this likelihood computation to construct a likelihood ratio test that a given species is a hybrid of two parental species. Simulations demonstrate that our test is more powerful than existing tests of hybridization, including             HyDe             , and that it achieves the desired type I error rate. We apply the method to two empirical data sets, one for which hybridization is believed to have occurred and one for which previous methods have failed to detect hybridization.},

A useful methodological framework for this purpose is F-statistics that measure shared genetic drift between sets of two, three, and four populations and can be used to test simple and complex hypotheses about admixture between populations. This article provides context from phylogenetic and population genetic theory. I review how F-statistics can be interpreted as branch lengths or paths and derive new interpretations, using coalescent theory. I further show that the admixture tests can be interpreted as testing general properties of phylogenies, allowing extension of some ideas applications to arbitrary phylogenetic trees. The new results are used to investigate the behavior of the statistics under different models of population structure and show how population substructure complicates inference. The results lead to simplified estimators in many cases, and I recommend to replace F3 with the average number of pairwise differences for estimating population divergence.},

Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

The commonly used method for estimating ancestral population sizes, based on counting mismatches between the species tree and the inferred gene trees, is highly biased as it ignores uncertainties in gene tree reconstruction. In this article, we develop a Bayes method for simultaneous estimation of the species divergence times and current and ancestral population sizes. The method uses DNA sequence data from multiple loci and extracts information about conflicts among gene tree topologies and coalescent times to estimate ancestral population sizes. The topology of the species tree is assumed known. A Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm is implemented to integrate over uncertain gene trees and branch lengths (or coalescence times) at each locus as well as species divergence times. The method can handle any species tree and allows different numbers of sequences at different loci. We apply the method to published noncoding DNA sequences from the human and the great apes. There are strong correlations between posterior estimates of speciation times and ancestral population sizes. With the use of an informative prior for the human-chimpanzee divergence date, the population size of the common ancestor of the two species is estimated to be {$\sim$}20,000, with a 95\% credibility interval (8000, 40,000). Our estimates, however, are affected by model assumptions as well as data quality. We suggest that reliable estimates have yet to await more data and more realistic models.},

  abstract = {Gene phylogenies provide a rich source of information about the way evolution shapes genomes, populations, and phenotypes. In addition to substitutions, evolutionary events such as gene duplication and loss (as well as horizontal transfer) play a major role in gene evolution, and many phylogenetic models have been developed in order to reconstruct and study these events. However, these models typically make the simplifying assumption that population-related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) are negligible. While this assumption may have been reasonable in some settings, it has become increasingly problematic as increased genome sequencing has led to denser phylogenies, where effects such as ILS are more prominent. To address this challenge, we present a new probabilistic model, DLCoal, that defines gene duplication and loss in a population setting, such that coalescence and ILS can be directly addressed. Interestingly, this model implies that in addition to the usual gene tree and species tree, there exists a third tree, the locus tree, which will likely have many applications. Using this model, we develop the first general reconciliation method that accurately infers gene duplications and losses in the presence of ILS, and we show its improved inference of orthologs, paralogs, duplications, and losses for a variety of clades, including flies, fungi, and primates. Also, our simulations show that gene duplications increase the frequency of ILS, further illustrating the importance of a joint model. Going forward, we believe that this unified model can offer insights to questions in both phylogenetics and population genetics.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT             Minimum spanning trees (MSTs) are frequently used in molecular epidemiology research to estimate relationships among individual strains or isolates. Nevertheless, there are significant caveats to MST algorithms that have been largely ignored in molecular epidemiology studies and that have the potential to confound or alter the interpretation of the results of those analyses. Specifically, (i) presenting a single, arbitrarily selected MST illustrates only one of potentially many equally optimal solutions, and (ii) statistical metrics are not used to assess the credibility of MST estimations. Here, we survey published MSTs previously used to infer microbial population structure in order to determine the effect of these factors. We propose a technique to estimate the number of alternative MSTs for a data set and find that multiple MSTs exist for each case in our survey. By implementing a bootstrapping metric to evaluate the reliability of alternative MST solutions, we discover that they encompass a wide range of credibility values. On the basis of these observations, we conclude that current approaches to studying population structure using MSTs are inadequate. We instead propose a systematic approach to MST estimation that bases analyses on the optimal computation of an input distance matrix, provides information about the number and configurations of alternative MSTs, and allows identification of the most credible MST or MSTs by using a bootstrapping metric. It is our hope this algorithm will become the new ``gold standard'' approach for analyzing MSTs for molecular epidemiology so that this generally useful computational approach can be used informatively and to its full potential.},

This has simultaneously led to a dramatic improvement in our understanding of phylogenetic relationships and a better appreciation for an array of methodological problems that continue to hinder progress in phylogenetic studies of certain data sets and/or particular parts of the tree of life. This review focuses on several persistent problems, including rooting, conflict among data sets, weak support in trees, strong but evidently incorrect support, and the computational issues arising when methods are applied to the large data sets that are becoming increasingly commonplace. We frame each of these issues as a specific problem to be overcome, review the relevant theoretical and empirical literature, and suggest solutions, or at least strategies, for further investigation of the issues involved.},

Initially, allozyme data and more recently highly polymorphic microsatellite markers have been used to obtain this information. We used both markers to assess the effectiveness of four assignment methods (STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS, BAPS and GeneClass) to detect hatchery introgression in wild stocked populations. Simulations of hybrid genotypes from real parental data revealed that the number and type of markers used with STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS and BAPS can identify as admixed most first and second generation hybrids as well as first generation backcrosses. In wild populations, introgression rates estimated from different markers and methods were correlated. However, slight disagreements were observed at both population and individual levels. Overall, the fully Bayesian (STRUCTURE, NEWHYBRIDS and BAPS) performed better than partially Bayesian (GeneClass) assignment tests. In wild collections, BAPS analyses were limited because of the lack of a native baseline. In all cases, the efficiency of methods was reduced as introgression increased.}

Taxonomic profiling is one of the critical steps in metagenomic analyses. Marker genes, which are single-copy and universally found across Bacteria and Archaea, can provide accurate estimates of taxon abundances in the sample.                                         Results               We present TIPP2, a marker gene-based abundance profiling method, which combines phylogenetic placement with statistical techniques to control classification precision and recall. TIPP2 includes an updated set of reference packages and several algorithmic improvements over the original TIPP method. We find that TIPP2 provides comparable or better estimates of abundance than other profiling methods (including Bracken, mOTUsv2 and MetaPhlAn2), and strictly dominates other methods when there are under-represented (novel) genomes present in the dataset.

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               The application of machine learning approaches in phylogenetics has been impeded by the vast model space associated with inference. Supervised machine learning approaches require data from across this space to train models. Because of this, previous approaches have typically been limited to inferring relationships among unrooted quartets of taxa, where there are only three possible topologies. Here, we explore the potential of generative adversarial networks (GANs) to address this limitation. GANs consist of a generator and a discriminator: at each step, the generator aims to create data that is similar to real data, while the discriminator attempts to distinguish generated and real data. By using an evolutionary model as the generator, we use GANs to make evolutionary inferences. Since a new model can be considered at each iteration, heuristic searches of complex model spaces are possible. Thus, GANs offer a potential solution to the challenges of applying machine learning in phylogenetics.                                         Results               We developed phyloGAN, a GAN that infers phylogenetic relationships among species. phyloGAN takes as input a concatenated alignment, or a set of gene alignments, and infers a phylogenetic tree either considering or ignoring gene tree heterogeneity. We explored the performance of phyloGAN for up to 15 taxa in the concatenation case and 6 taxa when considering gene tree heterogeneity. Error rates are relatively low in these simple cases. However, run times are slow and performance metrics suggest issues during training. Future work should explore novel architectures that may result in more stable and efficient GANs for phylogenetics.                                         Availability and implementation               phyloGAN is available on github: https://github.com/meganlsmith/phyloGAN/.},

Owing to the diversity of the superfamily, phylogenetic analysis is challenging and prokaryotic serpins have been speculated to have been acquired from Metazoa through horizontal gene transfer due to their unexpectedly high homology. Here, we have leveraged a structural alignment of diverse serpins to generate a comprehensive 6,000-sequence phylogeny that encompasses serpins from all kingdoms of life. We show that in addition to a central ``hub'' of highly conserved serpins, there has been extensive diversification of the superfamily into many novel functional clades. Our analysis indicates that the hub proteins are ancient and are similar because of convergent evolution, rather than the alternative hypothesis of horizontal gene transfer. This work clarifies longstanding questions in the evolution of serpins and provides new directions for research in the field of serpin biology.},

The statistical confidence of interior branches as judged by posterior probabilities in Bayesian analysis is generally higher than that as judged by bootstrap probabilities in maximum likelihood analysis, and this difference has been interpreted as an indication that bootstrap support may be too conservative. However, it is possible that the posterior probabilities are too high or too liberal instead. Here, we show by computer simulation that posterior probabilities in Bayesian analysis can be excessively liberal when concatenated gene sequences are used, whereas bootstrap probabilities in neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood analyses are generally slightly conservative. These results indicate that bootstrap probabilities are more suitable for assessing the reliability of phylogenetic trees than posterior probabilities and that the mammalian and plant phylogenies may not have been fully resolved.},

A phylogenetically informative event in a gene tree constructed from nucleotide differences consists of interspecific coalescences of genes in each of which two genes sampled from different populations are descended from a common ancestor. The consistency probability between gene and population trees in which they are topologically identical was formulated in terms of interspecific coalescences. It was found that the consistency probability thus derived substantially increases as the sample size of genes increases, unless the divergence time of populations is very long compared to population sizes. Hence, there are cases where large samples at a locus are very useful in inferring a population tree.},

Because allopolyploids are formed via hybridization, the homoeologous copies of genes within them are at least as divergent as orthologs in the parental species that came together to form them. This means that common methods for estimating the parental lineages of allopolyploidy events are not accurate, and can lead to incorrect inferences about the number of gene duplications and losses. Here, we have adapted an algorithm for topology-based gene-tree reconciliation to work with multi-labeled trees (MUL-trees). By definition, MUL-trees have some tips with identical labels, which makes them a natural representation of the genomes of polyploids. Using this new reconciliation algorithm we can: accurately place allopolyploidy events on a phylogeny, identify the parental lineages that hybridized to form allopolyploids, distinguish between allo-, auto-, and (in most cases) no polyploidy, and correctly count the number of duplications and losses in a set of gene trees. We validate our method using gene trees simulated with and without polyploidy, and revisit the history of polyploidy in data from the clades including both baker's yeast and bread wheat. Our re-analysis of the yeast data confirms the allopolyploid origin and parental lineages previously identified for this group. The method presented here should find wide use in the growing number of genomes from species with a history of polyploidy. [Polyploidy; reconciliation; whole-genome duplication.]},

Our knowledge on HGF relies on detection methods that exploit some of its signatures left on extant genomes. One of them is the effect of HGF on branch lengths of constructed phylogenies. This signature has been formalized in statistical tests for HGF detection and used for example to detect massive adaptive gene flows in malaria vectors or to order evolutionary events involved in eukaryogenesis. However, these studies rely on the assumption that ghost lineages (all unsampled extant and extinct taxa) have little influence. We demonstrate here with simulations and data reanalysis that when considering the more realistic condition that unsampled taxa are legion compared to sampled ones, the conclusion of these studies become unfounded or even reversed. This illustrates the necessity to recognize the existence of ghosts in evolutionary studies.},

  abstract = {Hybrid or ``recombinational'' speciation refers to the origin of a new homoploid species via hybridization between chromosomally or genetically divergent parental species. Theory predicts that this mode of speciation is punctuated, but there has been little empirical evidence to support this claim. Here, we test the hypothesis of rapid hybrid speciation by estimating the sizes of parental species chromosomal blocks in               Helianthus anomalus               , a wild sunflower species derived via hybridization between               H. annuus               and               H. petiolaris               . Analysis of the frequency spectrum of parental species chromosomal blocks with respect to predictions based on R. A. Fisher's [Fisher, R. A. (1953)               Heredity               8, 187--197] junctions approach, suggests that               H. anomalus               arose rapidly, probably in fewer than 60 generations. This result is corroborated by independent lines of evidence demonstrating (               i               ) a significant concordance between the genomes of               H. anomalus               and early generation               H. annuus               {\texttimes}               H. petiolaris               synthetic hybrids, and (               ii               ) a rapid recovery of pollen fertility in these synthetic hybrid lineages. These results are not only consistent with theory but also provide a new and general method for estimating the tempo of hybrid speciation and dating the origin of hybrid zones.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of the evolutionary history of primates is undergoing continual revision due to ongoing genome sequencing efforts. Bolstered by growing fossil evidence, these data have led to increased acceptance of once controversial hypotheses regarding phylogenetic relationships, hybridization and introgression, and the biogeographical history of primate groups. Among these findings is a pattern of recent introgression between species within all major primate groups examined to date, though little is known about introgression deeper in time. To address this and other phylogenetic questions, here, we present new reference genome assemblies for 3 Old World monkey (OWM) species: Colobus angolensis ssp. palliatus (the black and white colobus), Macaca nemestrina (southern pig-tailed macaque), and Mandrillus leucophaeus (the drill). We combine these data with 23 additional primate genomes to estimate both the species tree and individual gene trees using thousands of loci. While our species tree is largely consistent with previous phylogenetic hypotheses, the gene trees reveal high levels of genealogical discordance associated with multiple primate radiations. We use strongly asymmetric patterns of gene tree discordance around specific branches to identify multiple instances of introgression between ancestral primate lineages. In addition, we exploit recent fossil evidence to perform fossil-calibrated molecular dating analyses across the tree. Taken together, our genome-wide data help to resolve multiple contentious sets of relationships among primates, while also providing insight into the biological processes and technical artifacts that led to the disagreements in the first place.},

  abstract = {The statistical methods applied to the analysis of genomic data do not account for uncertainty in the sequence alignment. Indeed, the alignment is treated as an observation, and all of the subsequent inferences depend on the alignment being correct. This may not have been too problematic for many phylogenetic studies, in which the gene is carefully chosen for, among other things, ease of alignment. However, in a comparative genomics study, the same statistical methods are applied repeatedly on thousands of genes, many of which will be difficult to align. Using genomic data from seven yeast species, we show that uncertainty in the alignment can lead to several problems, including different alignment methods resulting in different conclusions.},

  abstract = {Accurate gene tree-species tree reconciliation is fundamental to inferring the evolutionary history of a gene family. However, although it has long been appreciated that population-related effects such as incomplete lineage sorting (ILS) can dramatically affect the gene tree, many of the most popular reconciliation methods consider discordance only due to gene duplication and loss (and sometimes horizontal gene transfer). Methods that do model ILS are either highly parameterized or consider a restricted set of histories, thus limiting their applicability and accuracy. To address these challenges, we present a novel algorithm DLCpar for inferring a most parsimonious (MP) history of a gene family in the presence of duplications, losses, and ILS. Our algorithm relies on a new reconciliation structure, the labeled coalescent tree (LCT), that simultaneously describes coalescent and duplication-loss history. We show that the LCT representation enables an exhaustive and efficient search over the space of reconciliations, and, for most gene families, the least common ancestor (LCA) mapping is an optimal solution for the species mapping between the gene tree and species tree in an MP LCT. Applying our algorithm to a variety of clades, including flies, fungi, and primates, as well as to simulated phylogenies, we achieve high accuracy, comparable to sophisticated probabilistic reconciliation methods, at reduced run time and with far fewer parameters. These properties enable inferences of the complex evolution of gene families across a broad range of species and large data sets.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Background               Blowflies are ubiquitous insects, often shiny and metallic, and the larvae of many species provide important ecosystem services (e.g., recycling carrion) and are used in forensics and debridement therapy. Yet, the taxon has repeatedly been recovered to be para- or polyphyletic, and the lack of a well-corroborated phylogeny has prevented a robust classification.                                         Results                                We here resolve the relationships between the different blowfly subclades by including all recognized subfamilies in a phylogenomic analysis using 2221 single-copy nuclear protein-coding genes of Diptera. Maximum likelihood (ML), maximum parsimony (MP), and coalescent-based phylogeny reconstructions all support the same relationships for the full data set. Based on this backbone phylogeny, blowflies are redefined as the most inclusive monophylum within the superfamily Oestroidea not containing Mesembrinellidae, Mystacinobiidae, Oestridae, Polleniidae, Sarcophagidae, Tachinidae, and Ulurumyiidae. The constituent subfamilies are re-classified as Ameniinae (including the Helicoboscinae,                 syn. nov.                 ), Bengaliinae, Calliphorinae (including Aphyssurinae,                 syn. nov.                 , Melanomyinae,                 syn. nov.                 , and Toxotarsinae,                 syn. nov.                 ), Chrysomyinae, Luciliinae, Phumosiinae, Rhiniinae                 stat. rev.                 , and Rhinophorinae                 stat. rev                 . Metallic coloration in the adult is shown to be widespread but does not emerge as the most likely ground plan feature.                                                        Conclusions               Our study provides the first phylogeny of oestroid calyptrates including all blowfly subfamilies. This allows settling a long-lasting controversy in Diptera by redefining blowflies as a well-supported monophylum, and blowfly classification is adjusted accordingly. The archetypical blowfly trait of carrion-feeding maggots most likely evolved twice, and the metallic color may not belong to the blowfly ground plan.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Phylogenetic networks provide a powerful framework for modeling and analyzing reticulate evolutionary histories. While polyploidy has been shown to be prevalent not only in plants but also in other groups of eukaryotic species, most work done thus far on phylogenetic network inference assumes diploid hybridization. These inference methods have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to data sets with polyploid species, even though polyploidy violates the mathematical assumptions underlying these methods. Statistical methods were developed recently for handling specific types of polyploids and so were parsimony methods that could handle polyploidy more generally yet while excluding processes such as incomplete lineage sorting. In this article, we introduce a new method for inferring most parsimonious phylogenetic networks on data that include polyploid species. Taking gene tree topologies as input, the method seeks a phylogenetic network that minimizes deep coalescences while accounting for polyploidy. We demonstrate the performance of the method on both simulated and biological data. The inference method as well as a method for evaluating evolutionary hypotheses in the form of phylogenetic networks are implemented and publicly available in the PhyloNet software package.

While it has long been noted to produce spuriously high posterior probabilities for trees or clades, the precise reasons for this overconfidence are unknown. Here we characterize the behavior of Bayesian model selection when the compared models are misspecified and demonstrate that when the models are nearly equally wrong, the method exhibits unpleasant polarized behaviors, supporting one model with high confidence while rejecting others. This provides an explanation for the empirical observation of spuriously high posterior probabilities in molecular phylogenetics.           ,              The Bayesian method is noted to produce spuriously high posterior probabilities for phylogenetic trees in analysis of large datasets, but the precise reasons for this overconfidence are unknown. In general, the performance of Bayesian selection of misspecified models is poorly understood, even though this is of great scientific interest since models are never true in real data analysis. Here we characterize the asymptotic behavior of Bayesian model selection and show that when the competing models are equally wrong, Bayesian model selection exhibits surprising and polarized behaviors in large datasets, supporting one model with full force while rejecting the others. If one model is slightly less wrong than the other, the less wrong model will eventually win when the amount of data increases, but the method may become overconfident before it becomes reliable. We suggest that this extreme behavior may be a major factor for the spuriously high posterior probabilities for evolutionary trees. The philosophical implications of our results to the application of Bayesian model selection to evaluate opposing scientific hypotheses are yet to be explored, as are the behaviors of non-Bayesian methods in similar situations.},

The potential for discordance between the gene trees has motivated the development of summary methods that reconstruct a species tree from an input collection of gene trees. ASTRAL is a widely used summary method and has been able to scale to relatively large datasets. However, the size of genomic datasets is quickly growing. Despite its relative efficiency, the current single-threaded implementation of ASTRAL is falling behind the data growth trends is not able to analyze the largest available datasets in a reasonable time.                                         Results               ASTRAL uses dynamic programing and is not trivially parallel. In this paper, we introduce ASTRAL-MP, the first version of ASTRAL that can exploit parallelism and also uses randomization techniques to speed up some of its steps. Importantly, ASTRAL-MP can take advantage of not just multiple CPU cores but also one or several graphics processing units (GPUs). The ASTRAL-MP code scales very well with increasing CPU cores, and its GPU version, implemented in OpenCL, can have up to 158{\texttimes} speedups compared to ASTRAL-III. Using GPUs and multiple cores, ASTRAL-MP is able to analyze datasets with 10~000 species or datasets with more than 100~000 genes in \&lt;2 days.

Applying this result to counting rooted phylogenetic networks, we show that there are exactly                                                         \${\textbackslash}frac \{(2n)!\}\{2{\textasciicircum}\{n\} (n-1)!\}-2{\textasciicircum}\{n-1\} n!\$                                                                                                (                           2                           n                           )                           !                                                                                                                                         2                                                                                         n                                                                                   (                           n                           -                           1                           )                           !                                                                       -                                                                           2                                                                             n                           -                           1                                                                       n                       !                                                                          binary phylogenetic networks with one reticulate node on                 n                 taxa.                                                        Conclusions               The work makes two contributions to understand normal networks. One is a generalization of an enumeration procedure for phylogenetic trees into one for normal networks. Another is simple formulas for counting normal networks and phylogenetic networks that have only one reticulate node.},

  abstract = {Abstract Persian walnut (Juglans regia) is cultivated worldwide for its high-quality wood and nuts, but its origin has remained mysterious because in phylogenies it occupies an unresolved position between American black walnuts and Asian butternuts. Equally unclear is the origin of the only American butternut, J. cinerea. We resequenced the whole genome of 80 individuals from 19 of the 22 species of Juglans and assembled the genome of its relatives Pterocarya stenoptera and Platycarya strobilacea. Using phylogenetic-network analysis of single-copy nuclear genes, genome-wide site pattern probabilities, and Approximate Bayesian Computation, we discovered that J. regia (and its landrace J. sigillata) arose as a hybrid between the American and the Asian lineages and that J. cinerea resulted from massive introgression from an immigrating Asian butternut into the genome of an American black walnut. Approximate Bayesian Computation modeling placed the hybrid origin in the late Pliocene, {$\sim$}3.45 My, with both parental lineages since having gone extinct in Europe.}

  abstract = {Abstract             Phylogenetic inference from genome-wide data (phylogenomics) has revolutionized the study of evolution because it enables accounting for discordance among evolutionary histories across the genome. To this end, summary methods have been developed to allow accurate and scalable inference of species trees from gene trees. However, most of these methods, including the widely used ASTRAL, can only handle single-copy gene trees and do not attempt to model gene duplication and gene loss. As a result, most phylogenomic studies have focused on single-copy genes and have discarded large parts of the data. Here, we first propose a measure of quartet similarity between single-copy and multicopy trees that accounts for orthology and paralogy. We then introduce a method called ASTRAL-Pro (ASTRAL for PaRalogs and Orthologs) to find the species tree that optimizes our quartet similarity measure using dynamic programing. By studying its performance on an extensive collection of simulated data sets and on real data sets, we show that ASTRAL-Pro is more accurate than alternative methods.},

However, the most scalable species tree inference methods, which summarize independently inferred gene trees to obtain a species tree, are sensitive to hard-to-avoid errors introduced in the gene tree estimation step. This dilemma has created much debate on the merits of concatenation versus summary methods and practical obstacles to using summary methods more widely and to the exclusion of concatenation. The most successful attempt at making summary methods resilient to noisy gene trees has been contracting low support branches from the gene trees. Unfortunately, this approach requires arbitrary thresholds and poses new challenges. Here, we introduce threshold-free weighting schemes for the quartet-based species tree inference, the metric used in the popular method ASTRAL. By reducing the impact of quartets with low support or long terminal branches (or both), weighting provides stronger theoretical guarantees and better empirical performance than vanilla ASTRAL. Significantly, weighting by support makes ASTRAL a statistically consistent estimator with estimated (not true) gene trees as input, assuming support values satisfy certain conditions. More consequentially, weighting dramatically improves accuracy in a wide range of simulations and reduces the gap with concatenation in conditions with low gene tree discordance and high noise. On empirical data, weighting improves congruence with concatenation and increases support. Together, our results show that weighting, enabled by a new optimization algorithm we introduce, dramatically improves the utility of summary methods and can reduce the incongruence often observed across analytical pipelines.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Motivation               Reticulate evolutionary histories, such as those arising in the presence of hybridization, are best modeled as phylogenetic networks. Recently developed methods allow for statistical inference of phylogenetic networks while also accounting for other processes, such as incomplete lineage sorting. However, these methods can only handle a small number of loci from a handful of genomes.                                         Results               In this article, we introduce a novel two-step method for scalable inference of phylogenetic networks from the sequence alignments of multiple, unlinked loci. The method infers networks on subproblems and then merges them into a network on the full set of taxa. To reduce the number of trinets to infer, we formulate a Hitting Set version of the problem of finding a small number of subsets, and implement a simple heuristic to solve it. We studied their performance, in terms of both running time and accuracy, on simulated as well as on biological datasets. The two-step method accurately infers phylogenetic networks at a scale that is infeasible with existing methods. The results are a significant and promising step towards accurate, large-scale phylogenetic network inference.                                         Availability and implementation               We implemented the algorithms in the publicly available software package PhyloNet (https://bioinfocs.rice.edu/PhyloNet).
